<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to µWiki.  You might want to start by looking at the <a href=/view/SyntaxGuide>syntax guide</a> or
 creating a <a href=/view/TestPage>test page</a>.</p>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>µWiki is a very small (&lt;100 LOC) but fully functional wiki.  It makes heavy use 
of third-party code to provide most of its functionality, including:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/yaro/">Yaro</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">Selector</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">Markdown.py</a> (Note that 
the version being used in this prototype is out of date.)</li>
<li><a href="http://attacklab.net/showdown/">Showdown</a> (The µWiki UI is lifted more or les
s directly from Showdown)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an alpha-test version.  It works, but has a lot of known issues:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unicode handling is not being done properly</li>
<li>The UI CSS is a mess.  (And horror of horrors, it uses a table!)</li>
<li>The view page has no style sheet at all.</li>
<li>Source code has very little documentation (but there's very little source code
)</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a lot of missing features:</p>

<ul>
<li>No access control (my plan is to provide this as a separate independent WSGI w
rapper)</li>
<li>No revision control (ditto)</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the interface to the storage engine is modular, so that should make ad
ding these features easy.  The interface simply uses the dictionary protocol.  P
ersistent storage is provided by a class called fdict (File Dictionary) that use
s a file-based backing store.  Look at the source code (there's not much of it) 
for more info.</p>

<p>Since most of the code in µWiki is third-party code it is being made available u
nder the terms of those respective licenses.  The code that I wrote is hereby re
leased under the [MIT open-source license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mi
