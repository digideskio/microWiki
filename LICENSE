μWiki was written by Ron Garret and contains significant contributions
from other people.

Yaro and Selector were written by Luke Arno (http://lukearno.com/) and
are released under the GPL.

showdown.js was written by John Fraser and is released under a BSD licence.

auth.py incorporates code that is copyrighted by Facebook and
used according to the terms of their developer license.

μWiki code was originally released under the MIT license
(http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php) but because it
incorporates GPL code this was probably a violation of the GPL, though
IANAL.  If μWiki ever becomes popular enough for this to matter I'll
sort it out then.
