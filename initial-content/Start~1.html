<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to µWiki.  You might want to start by looking at the
<a href="../view/SyntaxGuide">syntax guide</a> or creating a <a href="../view/TestPage">test page</a>.</p>


<h2>About</h2>

<p>µWiki is a very small (~200 LOC) but (mostly) fully functional wiki.  It makes
heavy use of third-party code to provide most of its functionality, including:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/yaro/">Yaro</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">Selector</a></li>
<li>Showdown (The µWiki UI is lifted more or less directly from Showdown.)</li>
<li><a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> for some of the version control code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a beta-test version.  It seems to mostly work, but it might have
some issues with a few corner cases.  Also, the code could use a lot of
cleanup and documentation.</p>


<p>Since much of the code in µWiki is third-party code it is available
under the terms of those respective licenses.  The code that
I wrote is hereby released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT open-source
license</a>.</p>

<p>Changes since version 0.1:</p>


<ul>
<li>µWiki no longer uses markdown.py.  All markdown-to-HTML conversion is now
done in Javascript on the client side using Showdown.  This is to avoid having
to keep two different versions of the syntax synchronized.</li>
<li>Revision control has been added.  It does proper conflict detection using
Bazaar's merge3 algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<p>Changes since version 0.2:</p>


<ul>
<li>User logins have been added.  μWiki is now a fully industrial-strength
wiki, but still only about 3500 LOC <em>total</em>!  The wiki code itself
(not counting infrastructure) is only 155 LOC.</li>
</ul>
