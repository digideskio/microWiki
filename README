This is μWiki, a very small but fully functional wiki written by Ron
Garret.  It is as much an exercise in modular WSGI development as a
functional product.  The total code base is currently about 3500 lines
of code, of which only about 150 lines are the wiki proper.  Everything
else is infrastructure.

The current code base is the result of a major overhaul that added user
authorization through Facebook and OpenID (currently hard-coded to use
Google, but that's easy to change).  Some more work is needed to make it
easy for someone besides me to install it.  But this is more or less
what you have to do:

1.  Run ./content_init.py  (You will need a resident Javascript interpreter
to run this.  The original μWiki used a Python markdown->HTML converter,
but that was changed so that the same conversion code could run on the
server and the client.  Maintaining consistency between two different
markdown converters was too much bother.)

2.  Edit config.py appropriately.

3.  To run locally: python -i driver.wsgi

4.  To run under a server, make sure your content directory has appropriate
privileges set, and point a WSGIScriptAlias (or whatever your server uses)
to driver.wsgi.
