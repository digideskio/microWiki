This is μWiki, a very small but fully functional wiki written by Ron
Garret.  It is as much an exercise in modular WSGI development as a
functional product.  The total code base is currently about 3500 lines
of code, of which only about 150 lines are the wiki proper.  Everything
else is infrastructure.

The current code base is the result of a major overhaul that added user
authorization through Facebook and OpenID (currently hard-coded to use
Google, but that's easy to change).  Some more work is needed to make it
easy for someone besides me to install it.  But this is more or less
what you have to do:

1.  Install a Javascript interpreter at /user/local/bin/js.  Or edit
md2html appropriately.

2.  Edit config.py.  At a minimum you have to install your Facebook
application ID (if you don't have one you can get one at
http://developers.facebook.com/setup/) and at least one email address
in the admins variable.

3.  Run ./init.py

This will produce an invitation ID which you will need to generate
the initial user account.

4.  Start μWiki.  To run locally: python -i driver.wsgi.  To run under
a server, make sure your content directory has appropriate privileges
set, and point a WSGIScriptAlias (or whatever your server uses) to
driver.wsgi.

5.  Visit the URL generated in step 2 to set up the initial user account.

6.  To generate more user invitations, go to http://[your server]/invite
