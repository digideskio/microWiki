<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to µWiki.  You might want to start by looking at the <a href="SyntaxGuide" class="wikilink">syntax guide</a>.

<h2>About</h2>
<p>µWiki is a very small (&lt;100 LOC) but fully functional wiki.  It makes heavy use of third-party code to provide most of its functionality, including:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/yaro/">Yaro</a>
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">Selector</a>
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/">Markdown.py</a> (Note that the version being used in this prototype is out of date.)
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://attacklab.net/showdown/">Showdown</a> (The µWiki UI is lifted more or less directly from Showdown)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>This is an alpha-test version.  It works, but has a lot of known issues:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     Unicode handling is not being done properly
 </li>

 <li>
     The UI CSS is a mess.  (And horror of horrors, it uses a table!)
 </li>

 <li>
     The view page has no style sheet at all.
 </li>

 <li>
     Source code has very little documentation (but there's very little source code)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of missing features:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     No access control (my plan is to provide this as a separate independent WSGI wrapper)
 </li>

 <li>
     No revision control (ditto)
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the interface to the storage engine is modular, so that should make adding these features easy.  The interface simply uses the dictionary protocol.  Persistent storage is provided by a class called fdict (File Dictionary) that uses a file-based backing store.  Look at the source code (there's not much of it) for more info.
