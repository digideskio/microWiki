# Welcome

Welcome to µWiki.  You might want to start by looking at the [[syntax guide]].

## About

µWiki is a very small (<100 LOC) but fully functional wiki.  It makes heavy use of third-party code to provide most of its functionality, including:

* [Yaro](http://lukearno.com/projects/yaro/)
* [Selector](http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/)
* [Markdown.py](http://www.freewisdom.org/projects/python-markdown/) (Note that the version being used in this prototype is out of date.)
* [Showdown](http://attacklab.net/showdown/) (The µWiki UI is lifted more or less directly from Showdown)

This is an alpha-test version.  It works, but has a lot of known issues:

* Unicode handling is not being done properly
* The UI CSS is a mess.  (And horror of horrors, it uses a table!)
* The view page has no style sheet at all.
* Source code has very little documentation (but there's very little source code)

There are a lot of missing features:

* No access control (my plan is to provide this as a separate independent WSGI wrapper)
* No revision control (ditto)

Note that the interface to the storage engine is modular, so that should make adding these features easy.  The interface simply uses the dictionary protocol.  Persistent storage is provided by a class called fdict (File Dictionary) that uses a file-based backing store.  Look at the source code (there's not much of it) for more info.

Since most of the code in µWiki is third-party code it is being made available under the terms of those respective licenses.  The code that I wrote is hereby released under the [MIT open-source license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).
