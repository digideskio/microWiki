<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to µWiki.  You might want to start by looking at the
<a href=/view/SyntaxGuide>syntax guide</a> or creating a <a href=/view/TestPage>test page</a>.</p>


<h2>About</h2>

<p>µWiki is a very small (~200 LOC) but (mostly) fully functional wiki.  It makes
heavy use of third-party code to provide most of its functionality, including:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/yaro/">Yaro</a></li>
<li><a href="http://lukearno.com/projects/selector/">Selector</a></li>
<li><a href="http://attacklab.net/showdown/">Showdown</a> (The µWiki UI is lifted more or less directly from Showdown)</li>
<li><a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> for some of the version control code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is an alpha-test version.  It works, but has a lot of known issues:</p>


<ul>
<li>Unicode handling is not being done properly</li>
<li>The UI CSS is a mess.  (And horror of horrors, it uses a table!)</li>
<li>The view page has no style sheet at all.</li>
<li>Not enough documentation</li>
<li>No user model or access control.  That will be coming in the next version.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since much of the code in µWiki is third-party code it is available
under the terms of those respective licenses.  The code that
I wrote is hereby released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT open-source
license</a>.</p>

<p>Changes since version 0.1:</p>


<ul>
<li>µWiki no longer uses markdown.py.  All markdown-to-HTML conversion is now
done in Javascript on the client side using Showdown.  This is to avoid having
to keep two different versions of the syntax synchronized.</li>
<li>Revision control has been added.  It does proper conflict detection using
Bazaar's merge3 algorithm.</li>
</ul>
